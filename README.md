Welcome to my GitHub profile!

All the repositories hosted here are just mirrors from my Git server at
[git.oscarbenedito.com][]. Similarly, they are also mirrored on [Sourcehut][].
If in doubt, my server should be treated as the canonical URL.

## Contributing

Unless otherwise stated, the best way to contribute to my repositories is
through e-mailâ€”if you don't know how to do it and want to learn, I recommend to
check out [git-send-email.io][]). Send your patches to
[patches@oscarbenedito.com][] and change the subject prefix to specify the
repository you are sending the patch for. You can do that running the following
command from the git repository:

```
git config format.subjectPrefix "PATCH <name-of-repository>"
```

You can also contribute with pull requests here on GitHub or the equivalent on
Sourcehut once it's implemented.
